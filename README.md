## ðŸ“š Description

This plugin has the goal to solve a problem: Markdown links are more than just
file paths. A Markdown link in a wiki, for example, often looks like this:
`[My File](path/to/file.md)`. If the user's cursor is anywhere except in between
the parentheses then `gf` will not work. Or if the link points to a website
rather than a local file, then `gf` won't work, and if not setup correctly,
neither will `gx`. This plugin enhances these functionalities by defining a new
command `Traverse` that handles all of these cases elegantly and makes use of
the `confirm()` function (see `:help confirm()`) to handle cases where your
intent is not obvious.
